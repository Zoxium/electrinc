        <h1>Electrinc</h1>
        <h2>Basic stuff</h2>
        <p>- This game includes polynomial growth, which is where a generator produces the one below it. The first one producing the main currency. If you know Antimatter Dimensions, you should be familiar with this.</p>
        <p>- This game could be slightly unbalanced. I plan on it having a month worth of content.</p>
        <p>- This game is inspired from Antiamtter Dimensions.</p>
        <p>- This game will have around 4 or 5 prestige layers if I release the full version. (I'm saying "if" because I might stop working on this game. Let's just hope that doesn't happen.)</p>
        <p>- The text on this website that is <b>bold</b> represents a new header or important stuff.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Generators</h2>
        <h3>Generator initial prices:</h3>
        <p>1st generator: 10</p>
        <p>2nd generator: 100</p>
        <p>3rd generator: 10,000</p>
        <p>4th generator: N/A</p>
        <p>5th generator: N/A</p>
        <p>6th generator: N/A</p>
        <p>7th generator: N/A</p>
        <p>8th generator: N/A</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Generator price increases:</h3>
        <p>The generators will have their price increase by <span class="formulas">100^generator</span>, meaning the first generator will multiply its price by 100, the second one by 10K and so on.</p>
        <p>So</p>
